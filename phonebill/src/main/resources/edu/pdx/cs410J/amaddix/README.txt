**Disclosure- I think I started this assignment a little to close to the due date/ it took longer that expected to get
java/JDK reinstalled properly, and for the class files to install and work properly. So My project doesnt seem to
test very well**

This project currently reads in 3 strings from the command line, a customer name, caller phone number, and a callee
phone number. The main program reads in these args and confirms that the first arg is a string of only charactors,
and confirms both the following args are strings containing 10 digits (to match a phone number). If these requirements
are met, a phone bill is created with these values. Otherwise the program should exit and return an error message.
