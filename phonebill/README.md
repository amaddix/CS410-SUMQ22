  Project 1 reads in 3 arguments from the command line, and given that these arguments have met the requirements will be saved into the system as a phone bill. The first expects any length argument letters of numbers, to be saved as a customers first name. The second two specifically expect a string of 10 digits. The two strings of digits get saved as a phone call object, as a caller phone number and a callee phone number.
