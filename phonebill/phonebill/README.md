  Project 1 reads in 3 arguments from the command line, and given that these arguments have met the requirements will be saved into the system as a phone bill. The first expects any length argument letters of numbers, to be saved as a customers first name. The second two specifically expect a string of 10 digits. The two strings of digits get saved as a phone call object, as a caller phone number and a callee phone number.

  Project 2 allows user to call options from the command line with the arguments for a phone call (directly beforehand). The options allowed to the user are -print, -textFile, and -README.
  The -print displays the phonecall created from out command line arguments, -textFile pops up a menu that allows user to choose between reading to a file and from a file to create a new phone bill.
  The -README displays README contents and then exits program. The arguments that make up a phonebill are all strings. The first being a name (allowing letters and numbers), then the next argument lines have 
  digits with nothing else. The time is tested by a format that matches MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM.
